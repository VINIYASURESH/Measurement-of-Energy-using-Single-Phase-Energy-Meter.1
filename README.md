# Aim:
To measure energy using Single Phase Energy Meter

## Procedure:
Step 1: Make Connections as per the instructions given below:

S1 of MCB - A1 of Ammeter and A2 of Ammeter - V1 of Voltmeter
V1 of Voltmeter - Mw of Wattmeter and Mw of Wattmeter - C of Wattmeter
S2 of MCB - V of Wattmeter and V of Wattmeter - N1 of Energy Meter
N2 of Energy Meter - L2 of Load and Le of Energy Meter - L1 of Load
L of Wattmeter - M of Energy Meter and S2 of MCB - V2 of Voltmeter
NOTE : If wire is wrongly connected, Click on node number to detach the wire.

Step 2: Click on   CHECK  button for checking the connections.

Step 3: Click on the mcb off MCB to Turn ON mcb on the supply.

Step 4: Select the number of Bulbs from the Lamp Load.

Step 5: Count the number of times Green LED blinks in 1 min (Meter Counter) by using 'Stopwatch'.

Step 6: Enter the number of times Green LED blinks in 1 min (Meter Counter).

Step 7: Click on   ADD  button to add the readings to the Observation Table.

Step 8: Add different readings to the table by selecting different number of bulbs.

Step 9: Click on   PRINT  button to print the webpage.

Step 10: Click on   RESET  button to refresh the webpage.

## FORMULA
Actual Energy (A) = 
V*I*T /1000     kw-hr

Recorded Energy (R) = Number of Impulse (1min)/Meter Constant

Meter Constant = 3200 Imp/kw-hr

Relative Error = 
Râˆ’A /A *100%

Enter the no. of times Green LED blinks in 1min(Meter Counter):
